Durango was founded in 1880 by General William Palmer. William Palmer was a general in the Civil War. In 1880 he was the main developer of Denver and Rio Grande Railroad.  This railroad was planned to go from Denver to Texas. When silver and gold was discovered in Silverton Palmer decided it would be financially advantageous to also build a railroad spur to Silverton. Representatives of the Denver Rio Grande Railroad met with the town officials of Animas City asking for a train stop in their new town. The city council told the railroad they could build a train station in Animas City if they would pay for easement and fees. The railroad felt they shouldn’t have to pay any fees since the town would benefit financially from a railroad coming into town. The town council never budged from their position so the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad built the railroad anyway and founded the town of Durango. They built the railroad to go past Animas City without stopping. Although William Palmer built a Hotel and railroad in Durango he only stayed in Durango once on his way to Silverton.

General Palmer built this Hotel in 1898.

I’m not sure when the above picture was taken but I took the picture below in 2018.

# Strater Hotel

The Strater was built in 1887 by a pharmacist by the name of Henry Strater. Henry had a pharmacy at the corner entrance to the building. He leased out the rest of the building to H. L. Rice who ran the Stater Hotel. Unfortunately the lease Henry Strater wrote up did not exclude the pharmacy and H. L. Rice insisted that the Strater Pharmacy move out of the building. Without a legal leg to stand on Strater did move out of his own building. 

The below picture was taken in 1904. You can see the building originally had a clock tower.

You can see from this next picture shot in the mid 1950’s that the clock tower no longer exists. The hotel has also been extended to the west (the right in this picture).
