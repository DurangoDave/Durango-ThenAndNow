Durango was founded in 1880 by General William Palmer. William Palmer was a general in the Civil War. In 1880 he was the main developer of Denver and Rio Grande Railroad.  This railroad was planned to go from Denver to Texas. When silver and gold was discovered in Silverton Palmer decided it would be financially advantageous to also build a railroad spur to Silverton. Representatives of the Denver Rio Grande Railroad met with the town officials of Animas City asking for a train stop in their new town. The city council told the railroad they could build a train station in Animas City if they would pay for easement and fees. The railroad felt they shouldn’t have to pay any fees since the town would benefit financially from a railroad coming into town. The town council never budged from their position so the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad built the railroad anyway and founded the town of Durango. They built the railroad to go past Animas City without stopping. Although William Palmer built a Hotel and railroad in Durango he only stayed in Durango once on his way to Silverton.

​

General Palmer built this Hotel in 1898.

# Strater Hotel

![Strater Hotel](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DurangoDave/Durango-ThenAndNow/master/Strater%20Hotel.jpg)

The Strater was built in 1887 by a pharmacist by the name of Henry Strater. Henry had a pharmacy at the corner entrance to the building. He leased out the rest of the building to H. L. Rice who ran the Stater Hotel. Unfortunately the lease Henry Strater wrote up did not exclude the pharmacy and H. L. Rice insisted that the Strater Pharmacy move out of the building. Without a legal leg to stand on Strater did move out of his own building. 

The below picture was taken in 1904. You can see the building originally had a clock tower.

You can see from this next picture shot in the mid 1950’s that the clock tower no longer exists. The hotel has also been extended to the west (the right in this picture).

The above picture was taken in the 1970’s.  The Strater and the Francisco’s Buildings haven't changed much but 6th Street is now known as College Drive.

I took the picture below in 2018.

The First National Bank is the oldest continuous running business in Durango. It was founded in Animas City in 1880 and the next year this building was built.

# The Burns Bank

In 1892 this building was built as the Colorado State Bank. The bank failed during the silver crash of 1907. At that time the bank changed hands and became the Burns Bank. In 2000 the Bank of Colorado acquired the Burns Bank and used the building as a branch for a few years. Then the building became the Scoot'n Blues Cafe and Lounge until In September 2008. At that time the Irish Embassy opened in that location.
The above picture was taken in the 1920's. I took the picture below in 2018
