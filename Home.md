Santa Rita used to be where most of the Mexicans lived in Durango.

I do not have a date for the above picture but I took the picture below in 2018

Across the river was the Durango Smelter

# The Durango Smelter
In the late 1870's the mines near Silverton were doing great. John Porter was the manager of the Silverton smelter. The problem was Silverton didn't have any coal to power the smelter. Coal was hauled up from the Durango area on the train. Coal is heavy and this was expensive. John Porter decided to start his own smelter in Durango. The heavy ore could easily be carried down from Silverton to Durango where the coal was mined. Porter made a lot of money with his Durango smelter and his coal mine in Wildcat Canyon. Other coal mines were in Horse Gulch and the Boston Mine just west of Perins Peak.

The above picture of the Durango Smelter was taken in about 1890. The picture below was taken in 2018 from the same area.

# Animas City 

![Animas City South 1897](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DurangoDave/Durango-ThenAndNow/master/Animas%20City%20%201897%20(Medium).jpg)

The above picture (courtesy of U.S. Geological Survey www.usgs.gov) was shot in 1897. I shot the picture below in 2018.

![Animas City S 2018](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DurangoDave/Durango-ThenAndNow/master/Animas%20City%20%202018%20(Medium).jpg)

![Animas City N 1897](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DurangoDave/Durango-ThenAndNow/master/Animas%20City%201897%20(Medium).jpg)

The above picture (courtesy of U.S. Geological Survey www.usgs.gov) is another photograph of Animas City shot in 1897. 

I shot the picture below in 2018.

![Animas City N 2018](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DurangoDave/Durango-ThenAndNow/master/Animas%20City%202018%20(Medium).jpg)

Two things stand out in these pictures of Animas City:

1.   We have planted more trees than were originally in the Animas Valley.

2.  The glacial terminal moraines were more noticeable with fewer trees.

The terminal moraines are piles of rock and dirt that were pushed along by glaciers. As the glacier receded the moraine remained as a linear hill.

# The Porter Coal Mine

In the late 19th century the Porter Mine removed coal from Wildcat Canyon. They mined coal from many locations in the canyon. In 1889 they built a 2000 foot long tunnel.  It was a very rich, easy to mine vein of coal. Unfortunately, it was also a very limited vein. The mine stopped coal production in 1908.  

![Porter1905](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DurangoDave/Durango-ThenAndNow/master/Porter%20Mine%201905%20(Medium).jpg)

The above picture of the Porter Coal Mine was taken in 1905 (Photo courtesy of U.S. Geological Survey www.usgs.gov)

There was also a town called Porter that was behind the photographer.

I took the below picture of the same area in Wildcat Canyon SW of Durango in 2018.

![Porter2018](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DurangoDave/Durango-ThenAndNow/master/Porter%20Mine%202018%20(Medium).jpg)

![PorterTrippleOld](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DurangoDave/Durango-ThenAndNow/master/Porter%20Mine%20and%20tipple%20(Medium).jpg)

The above picture is of the tripple at the Porter Coal Mine that loaded coal onto rail cars. (Photo courtesy of U.S. Geological Survey www.usgs.gov)

The picture below is of the same area shot in 2018.

![PorterTripple2018](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DurangoDave/Durango-ThenAndNow/master/Porter%20Mine%20at%202018%20(Medium).jpg)

![Porter Town](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DurangoDave/Durango-ThenAndNow/master/Porter%20(Medium).JPG)

This is the Porter area. The Porter Coal mine is in the foreground and the town of Porter is further back.

I estimate the above picture was taken in the 1890â€™s. I took the picture below in 2018.

![Porter 2018](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DurangoDave/Durango-ThenAndNow/master/Porter%202018%20(Medium).jpg)

This next picture is of the mouth of Wildcat Canyon. The top path above County Road 141 used to be the railroad bed.   This railroad would cross over Lightner Creek. At that point there was a wye and the train could to on to the Boston Mine at Perins Peak or turn to Durango.

![Wildcat Mouth](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DurangoDave/Durango-ThenAndNow/master/Overlooking%20Wildcat%20(1)%20(Medium).JPG)

![Train Trestle](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DurangoDave/Durango-ThenAndNow/master/Train%20Tressel.jpg)

The above picture shows the train trestle crossing the road that goes on to town of Perrins (where the Boston Mine was). This road is now Highway 160 but up until 1962 Highway 160 to Hesperus and Cortez went through Wildcat canyon (County Rd 141) and then up through what is now county road 125. 

This next picture is shot from the same spot but taken in 2018.

![Train Trestle 2018](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DurangoDave/Durango-ThenAndNow/master/Train%20Tressel%202018%20(Medium).jpg)

This map from 1908 shows the railroad going from Porter (bottom of map) to Perins or from the wye the train could go on to Durango.

![Durango 1908 Map](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DurangoDave/Durango-ThenAndNow/master/Durango_1908%20Map.jpg)

![Train Twin Butte](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DurangoDave/Durango-ThenAndNow/master/Train%20and%20Twin%20Buttes%20%20BW.jpg)

The above picture is the trestle that went over the road we now call highway 160. One of the Twin Buttes is to the far right. The picture below is from the same area but shot in 2018.

![Train Twin Butte2018](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DurangoDave/Durango-ThenAndNow/master/Train%20and%20Twin%20Buttes%202018%20(Medium).jpg)

Here's another picture shot more than 100 years ago of a train going over the trestle bridge with the Twin Buttes in the background. The picture below is shot from the same location as my picture above.

![Train Twin ButteOLD](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DurangoDave/Durango-ThenAndNow/master/Train%20and%20Twin%20Buttes-Big.jpg)

![Twin Buttes 1896](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DurangoDave/Durango-ThenAndNow/master/Twin%20Buttes%20from%20mouth%20of%20Wildcat%20Canyon%201896%20(Medium).jpg)

Here are two pictures that were taken at the mouth of Wildcat Canyon. You can see the Twin Buttes in the background. In the above picture you can see the railroad in the upper left, just beyond the telephone pole.  The picture below was taken in 2018.

![Twin Buttes 2018](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DurangoDave/Durango-ThenAndNow/master/Twin%20Buttes%20from%20mouth%20of%20Wildcat%20Canyon%20%202018%20(Medium).jpg)

This map is from 1953. You can see the railroad going to Perins, Durango, Porter and beyond. At this time Highway 160 went through Wildcat Canyon. It then veers northwest on what is now called County Road 125. It wasn't until 1962 that Highway 160 was redirected past what we now call Durango West housing development. 

![Durango Map1953](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DurangoDave/Durango-ThenAndNow/master/Durango%201953%20map.jpg)

![LaPlata Mtns](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DurangoDave/Durango-ThenAndNow/master/La%20Plata%20Mtns.jpg)

The above picture is of Highway 160 as it heads down the valley toward Hesperus.  

The picture below is the same view but taken in 2016. This road in the foreground is now called County Road 125 and down in the valley we can see Highway 140.

# Lions Den

The Lionâ€™s Den was built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the late 1930â€™s. 

It is near the golf course overlooking Durango.

![LionsDenOLD](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DurangoDave/Durango-ThenAndNow/master/Lion's%20Den.jpg)

The above picture was taken in the early 1940â€™s. I took the below picture in 2018.

# Animas City Mountain

![Animas Mt OLD](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DurangoDave/Durango-ThenAndNow/master/Durango_Animas%20Mt.jpg)

This is the view from the Lions Den. I don't have a date for the above picture but I took the picture below in 2018.
