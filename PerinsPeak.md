# Baker’s Bridge

In 1860 Charles Baker came into the area where Silverton CO is now. He mined gold and later helped build a road down the Animas river valley.

Bakers bridge over the Animas River is 14 miles north of Durango. The old Bakers bridge pictured here was immediately north of the current Baker Bridge. The center support for the bridge is shown to rest on a large rock that no longer exists.  Why does so much water flow down to the left side of that support? Beyond the bridge you can see a wooden ‘dam’ diverting water to our left. I don’t know why such a structure was built.
