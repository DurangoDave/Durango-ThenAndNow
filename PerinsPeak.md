# Baker’s Bridge

In 1860 Charles Baker came into the area where Silverton CO is now. He mined gold and later helped build a road down the Animas river valley.

Bakers bridge over the Animas River is 14 miles north of Durango. The old Bakers bridge pictured here was immediately north of the current Baker Bridge. The center support for the bridge is shown to rest on a large rock that no longer exists.  Why does so much water flow down to the left side of that support? Beyond the bridge you can see a wooden ‘dam’ diverting water to our left. I don’t know why such a structure was built.

Below is another picture of Baker’s Bridge shot in 1895.

Water is running over the full length of the dam beyond the bridge.

These two pictures were taken from highway 550 south of Durango on what is known as Farmington Hill.

Otto Mears built many toll roads in the San Juan Mountains.

This is his toll booth at Bear Creek Falls on the Million Dollar Highway between Silverton and Ouray.

I shot this next picture in 2018 of the area where the toll booth used to be at Bear Creak Falls.

![BearCreekTollBooth](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DurangoDave/Durango-ThenAndNow/master/Bear%20Creek%20Toll%20booth.jpg)

Otto Mears also built a toll road from Animas City through Durango and Wildcat canyon to Fort Lewis south of Hesperus CO. He had a toll booth near Lightner Creek where highway 160 is today.
