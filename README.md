# The Durango Smelter
In the late 1870's the mines near Silverton were doing great. John Porter was the manager of the Silverton smelter. The problem was Silverton didn't have any coal to power the smelter. Coal was hauled up from the Durango area on the train. Coal is heavy and this was expensive. John Porter decided to start his own smelter in Durango. The heavy ore could easily be carried down from Silverton to Durango where the coal was mined. Porter made a lot of money with his Durango smelter and his coal mine in Wildcat Canyon. Other coal mines were in Horse Gulch and the Boston Mine just west of Perins Peak.

The above picture of the Durango Smelter was taken in about 1890. The picture below was taken in 2018 from the same area.
